## Project Overview

This project is designed to cover fundamental Java programming concepts, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming. As a QA professional, gaining proficiency in Java is essential for test automation, scripting, and understanding application behavior.

## Features

- **Problem-Solving Approach:** The primary focus of this project is to enhance the problem-solving skills using Java. Each module will present a unique problem or scenario that requires a Java solution.

- **Variables and Data Types:** Explore the use of variables and different data types in Java, including integers, strings, and booleans.

- **Object-Oriented Principles:** Delve into the four pillars of OOP - Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. Create classes and objects to model real-world entities.

- **Exception Handling:** Learn to handle exceptions using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks, ensuring robust error management in your programs.

- **User input:** Learn how to take user input from the console using the Scanner class, enhancing interactivity in your Java programs.

- **Conditional Statements:** Explore the use of if, else if, else, and switch case statements to make decisions based on certain conditions.

- **Loops:** Use loops like for and while to create repetitive structures in your programs.
